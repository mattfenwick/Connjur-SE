future plans for the CONNJUR-SE project:

 - performance improvements client-side
 - and tools for creating 1D and 3D sample schedules
 - add point-spread function for schedule analysis
 - refactor client-side to more closely follow MVC, MVP, or MVVM architecture pattern
 - add quadrature support in chart, possibly by creating multiple series
